## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities or security issues can be reported to `support at certifytheweb.com` - we do not currently operate a bug bounty program.
During normal use the app requires elevated permissions, this has associated risks which are documented here: https://docs.certifytheweb.com/docs/guides/security
